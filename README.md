# Cricket-Match-Occurrence-Prediction-Using-Python-and-ML
This project predicts whether a cricket match will occur or be canceled based on weather conditions using a Random Forest Classifier. Built with Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Gradio, the model takes in temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover to make its prediction.
